# What does each step (f1 to f4) specifically involve in the process

Based on the Informatica workflow and the insurance data processing context, here's what each phase (F1 to F4) specifically involves:

## **F1: Foundation and Data Preparation Phase**

This initial phase establishes the processing environment and prepares raw data for transformation:

**Data Initialization:**

- **SCI_CMQ_mt_Batch_Start_Cmq**: Initializes the batch session, sets up logging parameters, and establishes connection pools for the Claims Management Queue (CMQ) processing[^1][^2]

**Source Data Extraction:**

- **VW_DC_CONT_ROL_INS_CMQ**: Executes view-based extraction from data control sources, filtering insurance control data and establishing the foundational dataset[^3][^2]

**Staging Operations:**

- **Tf_Stage_Tables_Load_CMQ**: Loads raw extracted data into staging tables, providing temporary storage for data validation before main processing[^3][^4]
- **mT_POL_ID_SEQ_CMQ**: Generates unique policy identification sequences to ensure referential integrity across all policy-related records[^2][^5]

**Data Cleanup:**

- **sf_TGT_RECORDS_DELETE_CMQ**: Performs target table cleanup by removing outdated, duplicate, or logically deleted records to prepare for fresh data insertion[^4]


## **F2: Core Policy Data Processing Phase**

This phase handles the primary policy information and financial calculations:

**Policy Master Data:**

- **MT_SCTFL001_POLICY_AMT_CMQ**: Processes policy amounts, premium calculations, and financial data transformations[^5][^6]
- **mt_SCTFL001_POLICY_CMQ**: Transforms core policy attributes including effective dates, terms, conditions, and policy status[^2][^5]

**Transaction Management:**

- **mt_POLICY_UPD_TX_DEL_FLAG_CMQ**: Updates transaction deletion flags and manages policy transaction lifecycle states[^2]
- **tf_POLICY_UPD_POST_LOAD_CMQ**: Applies post-load business rules, data enrichment, and validation checks[^4][^6]

**Product Structure:**

- **mT_SCTFL011_POLICY_LINE_CMQ**: Processes policy line items, handling detailed coverage lines and product hierarchies within each policy[^5]


## **F3: Risk Assessment and Coverage Details Phase**

This phase manages geographic risk factors and detailed coverage information:

**Geographic Risk Processing:**

- **mt_SCTFL311_RISK_STATE_cmq**: Processes state-specific risk classifications and regulatory compliance requirements[^5]
- **mt_SCTFL021_RISK_LOCATION_CMQ**: Handles physical addresses, geographical coordinates, and location-based risk assessments[^5]

**Asset and Item Management:**

- **mt_SCTFL051_RISK_ITEM_CMQ**: Processes individual insured items, their classifications, and valuations[^5]
- **mt_SCTFL061_RISK_ITEM_BUILDING_CMQ**: Handles building-specific details including construction types and structural risk factors[^5]

**Party and Coverage Processing:**

- **MT_SCTFL371_BUSINESS_PARTY_CMQ**: Manages policyholder, beneficiary, and third-party relationship data[^5]
- **TF_SCTFL051_POLICY_FEATURE_cmq**: Processes optional policy features and enhancements[^5]
- **tf_SCTFL041_COVERAGE_CMQ**: Handles coverage types, limits, deductibles, and terms[^5]
- **tf_Modifier_cmq**: Applies rating factors, discounts, surcharges, and premium adjustments[^5]


## **F4: Financial Calculations and Process Closure Phase**

This final phase handles financial computations and completes the processing cycle:

**Financial Processing:**

- **tf_SCTFL171_TAX_SURCHARGE_CMQ**: Calculates state taxes, regulatory fees, and location-specific surcharges[^5]
- **mT_SCTFL301_POLICY_FORM_CMQ**: Processes policy forms, documentation requirements, and regulatory form assignments[^5]

**Specialized Risk Processing:**

- **mt_SCTFL431_PERIL_SCHD_RSK_LOC_cmq**: Handles peril schedules for specific risk locations, managing location-specific coverage details[^5]

**Process Finalization:**

- **mt_VW_DC_CONTROL_UPD_CMQ**: Updates data control tracking, processing status, and audit trail information[^2]
- **SCI_CMQ_mt_Batch_Close_cmq**: Closes the batch session, commits all transactions, and generates completion reports[^2]

Each phase follows the ETL pattern of extraction, transformation, and loading, with F1 focusing on data preparation, F2-F3 handling core business transformations, and F4 completing financial calculations and process closure[^3][^4]. The workflow uses parallel processing capabilities to optimize performance while maintaining data integrity throughout the insurance data processing pipeline[^2].
