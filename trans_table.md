Here‚Äôs a **High-Level Design (HLD)** for your mapping document in **Mermaid** syntax. This visual represents how data is mapped and transformed from source systems (like BMQ/DB2) into the target CBD system, including transformation logic and intermediary staging if needed.

### üîç Key Concepts from Your Mapping File Visualized:

* **A to B**: Extract raw data from DB2/BMQ.
* **C**: Sample data that helps validate mapping.
* **D**: Core of the Excel ‚Äì Mapping definitions.
* **E1-E3**: Field classifications: direct, derived, or new.
* **F1-F2**: Transformation logic tables.
* **G**: Final destination in CBD.
* **H**: CMQ is another system that might consume or validate this.
* **I-K**: Captures rules, logic, metadata which are all in your Excel columns.
